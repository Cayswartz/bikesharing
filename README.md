# Citibike Analysis

## Overview of Project
We are diving into the performance of Citibikes in New York during the summer to better understand the trends and habits around users of the bikes. We hope that by better understanding the trends in New York we will be able to make educated decision when we open another bike sharing operation in a new city. 

## Results

I wanted to utilize the above graphic so that the viewer could understand the true size of the sample that we were viewing and understand that the results are not just based of a small number of rides but rather over 2 million.

This chart represent how long the average consumer is using the bike. You can tell from this chart that there is a huge peak around 10 minutes and then it begins to decrease from there. The bikes seems to be used for short commutes or sightseeing but nothing longer.

After taking a look at the last chart I wanted to dive in a bit deeper to understand how therse trend vary per gender. In this chart you can see that while men tend to ride bikes more, we see the length of bike rides for each gender peak around the same time. Female riders may take slightly shorter rides in general but only by a minute or so.

Taking a look at this chart we are able to see the popularity of trips not only broken down by day of the week but also by hour. Here you can see that during the week there are more ride in the early morning and later afternoon, likely communtes to work, while on the weekends we see more consistency throughout the day.

Here we are looking at overall days that we seeing men and women riding their bikes. We see men riding  bikes much more often than woman but tend to see the popular times line up for both genders.

Again, we took a deeper dive into the chart above by gender looking at the trends by times and day by gender. Similar to above, we see the same heavy traffic times for both gender however we see that men overall ride the bikes more than female. Similar to the overall analysis we see people communting to and from work on the weekdays and evenly throughout daylight hours on the weekends.

Here we are looking at the popular areas for people to pick up there bikes. There tends to be more activity towards the bottom which could show that it is either a touristy location or a big commercial area where people may be commuting ot and from. 


## Results
Overall, we see similar trends and patterns for both males and females when it comes to riding bikes though men tend to ride bike more than women. We see lots of bike usage during commuting hours on weekdays and during the weekend there is more even usage throughout the entire day (or at least daylight hours). I would like to continue to dig into this and create a visualization around the age of the different riders and what age we see people picking up bikes at. Additioanlly, I think it would be interesting to create another visualization of the medium income of the people who are riding bikes. It would be interesting to see if people are consider this part of the cost of living in a big city or is more often something used by people who may have disposible income.
